This domain contains reference material of K&D Interactive, used during the development and releases. 

Notable is the  coding reference for best practices and the development cycle, that all members need to follow...

The website is echoing the content of the [github wiki](https://github.com/kdi/kdi.github.com/wiki/), which is included in this repo as a submodule (in "assets/html") 

If you'd like to see an update appear on this site feel free to update the wiki and then update the submodule (assuming the right priviledges)

```
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```
